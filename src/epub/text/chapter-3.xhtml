			<h2>A TALE OF THE DEAD</h2>
			<p>Once a carpenter was going home late at night from a strange village: he had been at a jolly feast at a friend’s house. As he came back an old friend met him who had died some ten years before.</p>
			<p>“How do you do?”</p>
			<p>“How do you do?” said the walker, and he forgot that his friend had long ago taken the long road.</p>
			<p>“Come along with me: let us have a cup together once more.”</p>
			<p>“Let us go.”</p>
			<p>“I am so glad to have met you again, let us toast the occasion.”</p>
			<p>So they went into an <i>izbá</i>,<a id="r1"/><a class="c012 pginternal" href="#f1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and they had a drink and a talk. “Well, good-bye; time I went home!”</p>
			<p>“Stay, where are you going? Come and stay the night with me.”</p>
			<p>“No, brother, do not ask me: it is no good. I have business at home to-morrow and must be there early.”</p>
			<p>“Well, good-bye.”</p>
			<p>“But why should you go on foot? Better come on my horse, and he will gallop along gaily.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
			<p>So he sat on the horse, and the horse galloped away like a whirlwind.</p>
			<p>Suddenly the cock crowed: it was a very terrible sight! Graves all around, and under the wayfarer a gravestone!</p>
