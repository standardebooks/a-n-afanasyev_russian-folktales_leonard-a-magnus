			<h2 epub:type="title">Christ and the Geese</h2>
			<p>One day <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter and Christ were out walking together. <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter was deep in thought and suddenly said: “How fine it must be to be God! If for half a day I might be God, then let me be Peter all the rest of my days!”</p>
			<p>The Lord smiled. “Your will shall be granted. Be God until nightfall.”</p>
			<p>They were approaching a village, and saw a peasant girl driving a flock of geese. She drove them to the meadow, left them there, and hurried back home.</p>
			<p>“Are you going to leave the geese by themselves?” <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, what?⁠—guard them today! It’s a feast-day.”</p>
			<p>“But who will look after the geese?”</p>
			<p>“God Almighty, maybe,” she said, and ran away.</p>
			<p>“Peter, you have heard her,” said the Saviour. “I should have been delighted to go with you to the village feast, but then the geese might come to some harm. You are God until nightfall, and must stay and watch them.”</p>
			<p>Poor Peter! He was angry; but had to stay and guard the geese. He never again wished to be God.</p>
