			<h2>Vazúza and Vólga</h2>
			<p>The Vólga and the Vazúza had a long argument whether who was the wiser and the stronger and the more honourable of the two. They contended and quarrelled, and could not decide it. So they resolved at last: “Let us both go to sleep at the same time, and the one which wakes up earlier and first reaches the Khvalýnsk Sea is wiser and stronger and the more honourable.”</p>
			<p>So the Vólga went to sleep, and so did the Vazúza.</p>
			<p>But at night the Vazúza got up quietly and ran away from the Vólga; she took the next nearest way and flowed off.</p>
			<p>When the Vólga woke up she went neither hurriedly nor lagging, but in an ordinary fashion. At Zubtsov she overtook the Vazúza, and looked so threatening that the Vazúza was frightened, and owned she was the younger daughter, and begged the Vólga to take her in her arms into the Sea of Khvalýnsk.</p>
			<p>And, to this day, the Vazúza wakes up in the spring before the Vólga, and wakes the Vólga up out of her winter sleep.</p>
