			<h2 epub:type="title">The Journey to Jerusalem</h2>
			<p>An archimandrite one day got up for matins; and, whilst laving his hands, saw an unclean spirit in the Holy Water, seized him and crossed him.</p>
			<p>The devil besought him: “Let me go, Father, I will do you any service I can; I will, I will!”</p>
			<p>So the Archimandrite said: “Will you take me to Jerusalem between High Mass and matins?”</p>
			<p>The Archimandrite released him, and after matins was transported to Jerusalem, and was back in time for High Mass. Then inquiries were set going how this might be, and everyone was astonished how he could get to Jerusalem and back so fast. They asked him about it, and he told them the story.</p>
