			<h2 epub:type="title">Christ and Folksongs</h2>
			<p>One day Christ and <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter were walking about the earth and came to a village. In one house folks were singing so finely that Christ stayed to listen, whilst <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter went on. He turned back and found Christ still at His post. <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter went on again, and looked back: Christ was still listening. <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter went on again and then glanced back a third time⁠—and Christ was still listening. Then he went back and heard a splendid folksong in the house, stayed a while, and went on to another house where there also was singing. There <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter stayed, but Christ passed on. <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter hurried up and looked astounded.</p>
			<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Christ.</p>
			<p>“I could not make out why you stopped to listen to folksongs and passed by the house where hymns were being sung.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, my dear son,” said Christ, “there was a good scent there in the one house where folksongs were being sung; but there was no reverence about the house where they were chanting hymns.”</p>
